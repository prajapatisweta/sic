Layer 2 Security
a.  Assign the Central switch as the root bridge.
b.  Secure spanning-tree parameters to prevent STP manipulation attacks.
c.  Enable port security to prevent CAM table overflow attacks

SOLUTION:
Create the topology as shown (No routing, pc, server configuration. Just use proper ports)

PART 1: Assign the Central switch as the root bridge.
    (MultilayerSwitch Command)
    show spanning-tree
    // Find the root and on which port it is connected.
    // Find the root using "show spanning-tree".
    // After finding the root, execute this command on that switch: 
    erase startup-config
    // Now go back to the multilayer switch and execute following commands:
    conf t
    spanning-tree vlan 1 root primary
    do show spann // -> This command is used to(verify) see if MultilayerSwitch has became primary or not.

PART 2: Protect Against STP Attack
    -- (SwitchA and SwitchB commands)
    enable
    conf t
    interface range fastEthernet0/1-2
    switchport mode access
    spanning-tree portfast
    -- (Switch1 and Switch 2 commands)
    enable
    conf t
    interface range fastEthernet0/23-24 (Use ports properly!!)
    spanning-tree guard root
    -- (SwitchA and SwitchB command)
    spanning-tree bpdguard enable

PART 3: Enable port security
    -- (SwitchA and SwitchB commands)
    switchport port-security
    switchport port-security maximum 2
    switchport port-security mac-address sticky
    switchport port-security violation shutdown

Verifying:
    -- (SwitchA and SwitchB commands)
    show port-security int f0/1

Shutting down the remaining ports (NOT SOOO IMP):
    -- (SwitchA and SwitchB commands)
    conf t
    interface range f0/3-22
    shutdown
