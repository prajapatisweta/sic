Configuring a Zone-Based Policy Firewall

part 1
// Create the toplogy and add connections 
// perform static routing
        ex. pc's network via nearby router connection

verify routes using ping command from pc to server

part 2
// Configuring ssh on router 0 (center one)
Commands for router 0:
    enable
    conf t
    ip domain-name sweet.com
    hostname R0
    crypto key generate rsa
    line vty 0 4
    transport input ssh
    login local
    exit
    username admin privilege 15 password admin

// verifying ssh using pc 
ssh -l admin <ip of router on which ssh was executed (192.168.3.1)>

PART  3: Create firewall zones on Router2 (Right one, left one according to exam slip)

///enable security package first
    Router>enable
    Router#conf t
    Router(config)#license boot module c1900 technology-package securityk9
    Router(config)#do write
    Router(config)#exit
    Router#reload

    enable
    conf t
    zone security in-zone
    exit
    zone security out-zone
    exit
    zone security in-zone
    exit
    access-list 101 permit ip <network of pc>192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 any
    class-map type inspect match-all in-map
    match access-group 101
    exit
    policy-map type inspect in-out     // if not working try outbound instead of in-out
    class type inspect in-map
    inspect
    exit
    exit
    zone-pair security in-out-zone source in-zone destination out-zone
    service-policy type inspect in-out
    exit
    interface gigabitEthernet0/0
    zone-member security in-zone
    exit
    interface Serial0/1/0
    zone-member security in-zone
    exit
    exit

PART 4: Testing firewall functionality (From in-zone to out-zone)
Step 1: Pinging SERVER from PC (Success)
Step 2: Start an SSH session from PC to router 1
        ssh -l admin <ip of center router on which ssh was performed> 11.1.1.1
        //without closing the ssh go to step 3
Step 3: Type following command in Router 2
#show policy-map type inspect zone-pair sessions

PART 5: Testing the firewall functionality (From out-zone to in-zone)
Pinging pc from server (Failure)
Hence the firewall functionality is verified.
